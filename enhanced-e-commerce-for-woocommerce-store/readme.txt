== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=  What is Google Shopping and how does it work? =

Google Shopping helps sellers make their shops and products available for millions of users across Google.Google Shopping is a new product discovery experience. The goal is to make it easy for users to research purchases, find information about different products, their features and prices, and then connect with sellers to make their purchase. Google Shopping enables users to view product information from the sellers that is updated on a regular basis by sellers. Online retailers submit feeds containing product information to Google Shopping. Since this product information comes directly from the seller, this means we‚Äôre able to show the current prices, latest offers and current product availability. Hence, Google Shopping helps ecommerce businesses find more customers to their websites.

= How do sellers enroll for Google Shopping? =

Create Merchant Center Account: Once you have an account open, verify important details like your business and contact information.

* What are we bringing for you?
Google Tag Manager based single click implementation for Google Analytics, Google Analytics 4, and multiple ad pixel integrations like Meta, Snapchat, Tiktok, Pinterest, Google Ads, Twitter, Microsoft Bing Ads
Use your own Google Tag Manager account with the conversios plugin.
* What will you get out of it?
  1. Google Tag Manager based implementation helps in data collection accuracy and you have more control over your tags implemented on the website.
  2. Many website‚Äôs page speed decreases because of gtag.js implementation as it renders multiple Javascripts on the website. Google Tag Manager based implementation uses datalayer to push data to GA or other ad channels and it renders only once on your web page. Hence, your site speed will be intact with this approach.
  3. Debugging which events are tracking correctly or not becomes a lot easier in Google Tag Manager based implementation. Hence, less possibility of data leakage from your web store and more insights from the visitors.
  4. Google Tag Manager based implementation will prepare you for the next privacy-centric industry revolution leveraging first party cookies. Sooner or later stores like yours will have to go for server side tagging. GTM based implementation is our first step for you in that direction.
  5. If you want us to add any other pixel in the plugin, shout out and that will be done in 3 business days.
